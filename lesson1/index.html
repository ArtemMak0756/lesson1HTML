    <b><u>The Simpsons</u></b> are the main protagonists of the TV show The Simpsons. The family first
    appeared on The Tracey Ullman Show, in the comedy short Good Night. The family has hundreds of relatives, including
    Mr. Burns and Patty and Selma.

<p>
    <b>Homer Jay Simpson</b> was born on May 12, 1956, to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was
    raised on the Simpson family farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and
    scaring the cows into giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer
    began drinking alcohol like his father and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car. According to a
    family tree designed by the creator of the show, Matt Groening, Mr. Burns, his boss, is a distant relative of him.

<p>
    <b>Bart</b> is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is constantly in detention and in addition to his
    behavior
    is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people began before he was born, Bart "mooned" Dr. Hibbert while he
    performed a sonogram on Marge when she was pregnant with him, and moments after being born, he set Homer's tie-on
    fire, starting his life as a prankster (although Marge claimed that he could not have done it on purpose because he
    was only ten minutes old). Bart's first words were "Ay Caramba" after he walked in on Homer and Marge at a
    bad time.

<p>
    <b>Lisa</b> is quite eclectic in her knowledge and is notably more concerned with world affairs and problems than her
    cohorts, which has led her to alienate herself from her peers. Lisa also deeply values her integrity, sometimes at
    the expense of others' needs and happiness, as demonstrated when she cheats on a test in The Wind in the Willows to
    attain her highest grade of A-plus, but later admits her dishonesty to an unreceptive Principal Skinner despite the
    fact that such a grade allowed the school to gain the extra income it 'desperately' needs.
